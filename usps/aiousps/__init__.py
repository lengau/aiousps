"""USPS API using asyncio and aiohttp, allowing asynchronous requests.

This submodule provides an aiousps version of the usps-api module. It uses many
of the usps-api module's objects, but replaces network connections using
`requests` with `aiohttp` connections, allowing the module to be used
easily within an aiousps framework.
